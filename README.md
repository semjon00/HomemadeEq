### AutoEQ for handmade speaker

Anyhow I have a handmade speaker with a custom laser print on it - My Little Pony speaker, if you will. This is sound-improvement project for it.
It has a very, very, very bad sound emitter and a Bluetooth-enabled controller - joined in an unholy ensemble.
Why not make it slightly less bad?

See wiki for results 2024-08-25.

Play sweep line by the speaker -> measure peaks with Spectroid (Android) + ``processor.py`` + hacked AutoEQ = profit.

For hacking AutoEQ: DB Browser on ``auto_eq.db`` and then
```java -jar uber-apk-signer-1.3.0.jar -a C:\Users\semjon\Desktop\123\Wavelet+v24.05+(2168).apk```

speedrun quality project; it works

Fun fact: My Little Pony fandom is something else entirely.
Did you know that there are approximately 3 billion ("b" - the second alphabet letter, yes) words of fanfics published?
This is five thousand times more than the notoriously voluminous War and Peace.
